# clang-tools (clang-format, clang-query, clang-tidy) static binaries

## Download

Grab clang-tools static binaries for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-format-static-binaries/releases) tab!

## Motivation behind this repo

These binaries aim to:
- be as small as possible
- not require any additional dependencies apart from OS itself

## How can I trust this repository?

- Verify sha512sums of binaries against output from GitHub Actions to make sure binaries are not modified
- Fork this repository and run GitHub actions on your behalf
- Build manually using steps using commands from [.github/workflows](https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-format-static-binaries/tree/master/.github/workflows)

## More clang-tools

If there's any interest I could add more tools, or a build for new OS (ex. FreeBSD)
